<h4 class="alert-heading"> Dear Miners:</h4>

The reason you ZCL/BTCP count went down in the pool is due to a calculation error with the previous figure. As we had stated earlier, the code behind the calculations was being worked on to even get the stats to show up correctly. <br />
At the time of finding this calculation error we had mined 24 blocks (300 ZCL) but it showed over 1000 ZCL has been mined (clearly wrong). Sorry for the confusion! The error has now been corrected.<br /><br />

The ZCL/BTCP Totals calculation has been updated, it should now correctly reflect only CONFIRMED Blocks, Before it was showing totals based off of total share count of ALL blocks not just confirmed so it was causing the values to fluctuate
and down. This should now be resolved if there are any other issues please let us know in the #Mining channel of the <a href="https://discord.gg/PBxkYqd">Bitcoin Private Discord</a>.<br /><br />

      <b>Why Does my ZCL/BTCP Balance seem inaccurate for the time I have been mining?</b></p>
    <p class="q">
      The current blocks have to confirm fully ( After 100 Confirmations ) Then payments are processed and your balance will update accordingly. Please see the <a href="https://fund.zclassic.org/stats">Graph Stats</a> Page and look at current blocks found, blocks must be fully confirmed before payment processing occurs.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use a Z address to mine to this pool?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      No you will need to use a transparent address for mining to the pool, keep in mind this is how we will keep record of what you have mined and the amount of BTCP that you will get. You will need the private key to the address you mine with to receive your
      BTCP after the fork.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use an exchange address to mine with?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      You will need to use an address that is in a wallet where you have control of the private key. Make sure you save this address and backup the private key as you will need both to redeem your BTCP after the fork.</p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Why do i keep getting an Unauthorized or Authorization failed error message?</strong></p>
    <p class="q">
      You have to use a (transparent) T address as the user in your mining program, You cannot use a Z address or an exchange address. Also make sure that the address is valid as most authorization errors have been due to mistyping the address or case sensitive issues. Copy and paste whole t address when possible for best result and if you get authorization errors double check your address. Your address can be in the format of ( t_address.workername ) and you should connect with no problems.</p>
