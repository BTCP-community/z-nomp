  <strong> Dear Miners:</strong><br />
  Thank you for your involvement in our donation program; it means alot to us!<br /><br />

  We know that some users are unable to see mining stats for their address. This is normal, as we are experiencing some general trouble with the znomp platform. Rest be assured, your mining progress has been saved - we checked!<br /><br />

      <b>Why do my stats not show how much zcl I have currently mined?</b>
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      Currently the stats sections are being worked on to display proper values of BTCP for the amount of zcl that you have mined and donated. All work done in this pool is being saved into the database and the values on your stats pages will populate once
      the code has been finalized to calculate your amount of BTCP earned based off of your shares mined x 1.25.
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use a Z address to mine to this pool?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      No you will need to use a transparent address for mining to the pool, keep in mind this is how we will keep record of what you have mined and the amount of BTCP that you will get. You will need the private key to the address you mine with to receive your
      BTCP after the fork.
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      <strong>Can I use an exchange address to mine with?</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="q">
      You will need to use an address that is in a wallet where you have control of the private key. Make sure you save this address and backup the private key as you will need both to redeem your BTCP after the fork.
